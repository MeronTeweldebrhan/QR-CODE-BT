# QR Code Card Component

## Overview

This project is a clean and responsive QR Code Card Component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The component encourages users to improve their front-end skills by scanning a QR code that links to Frontend Mentor.

It includes:
* A centrally positioned QR code image
* A title and supporting description using semantic HTML
* An attribution footer
* Developed using Bootstrap utility classes for layout, spacing, and responsive design
* Additional custom utility classes for brand-specific colors and max-width constraints

--> The goal was to practice layout techniques, enhance responsiveness, and reduce custom CSS by utilizing Bootstrapâ€™s utility-first approach

Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome!
## My Process
1.Started with a basic HTML and CSS layout, focusing on semantic structure and visual hierarchy.

2.Used Bootstrap 5 to replace most custom CSS with utility classes (e.g., d-flex, text-center, p-4, mx-auto).

3.Implemented in line styles  for brand-specific colors and max-width constraints not available in Bootstrap.

### Built With

- **HTML5**: For semantic markup and structure.
-**Bootstrap**: 5 For utility-first styling, responsive layout, and spacing
- **CSS3**: For inline styling,  for layout specific values and responsive design.
- **Frontend Mentor**: The challenge provider that supplied the design and assets.

### What I Learned

- This project helped me strengthen my understanding of CSS layout techniques, particularly:
- This project deepened my understanding of responsive layout and Bootstrap utility classes. Key takeaways include:
- Using Bootstrapâ€™s d-flex, justify-content-center, and align-items-center classes to center content vertically and horizontally on the page.
- Constraining text with max-width and Bootstrap spacing utilities like mx-auto, mt-1, and mb-3 to ensure clean, readable layouts.
- Replacing custom CSS with Bootstrapâ€™s built-in components and utilities wherever possible to keep the code clean and maintainable.

```html bootstrap and inline styles
<body class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center m-0 min-vh-100 " style="background-color:#D5E1EF ;">
 <main>
<section class="card  rounded-4 p-3 text-center bg-white" style="width: 320px; height: 499px;">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="rounded-3 mb-4">
  <h1 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-1  mb-3 mx-auto " style="color:#1f3251; line-height:1.2; max-width:250px; ">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  <p class=" fw-normal fs-6" style="color: #7b879d; ">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</section>
</main>
```
  ## My Process
 
 ## Continued Development
  ### In future projects, I plan to:

* Explore more advanced CSS techniques like CSS Grid for complex layouts.
* Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and ensuring better contrast ratios.
* Experiment with animations to enhance the user experience, such as a hover effect on the QR code.
